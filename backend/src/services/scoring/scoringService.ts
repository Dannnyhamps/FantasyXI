 * - Starting XI points calculation from PlayerGameweekStats
 * - Captain 2x multiplier (with vice-captain fallback when captain played 0 mins)
 * - Automatic bench substitutions preserving valid formations
 * - Chips: Triple Captain (3x), Bench Boost (bench counts, no auto-subs),
 *   Wildcard / Free Hit (transfer point deductions waived)
 * - Head-to-head match resolution (Win 3 / Draw 1 / Loss 0)
 * - SquadGameweekScore persistence and total points aggregation
 *
 * Laravel equivalent: Like app/Services/ScoringService.php with event listeners
 * calculating gameweek results.
